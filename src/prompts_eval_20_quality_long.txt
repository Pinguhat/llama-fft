You are preparing a short explanation for a class on efficient transformers. In two sentences, explain why FFT-based structured matrices can reduce compute.
In a technical report, describe one advantage and one disadvantage of replacing dense MLP matrices with block-circulant approximations.
Explain how a teacher-student comparison using last-token logits can reveal approximation error in a patched model.
Suppose top-1 differs but top-5 overlap is high. Give a short interpretation of what that implies about the student distribution.
Describe why increasing block size can reduce parameters but may reduce model fidelity, using an intuitive argument.
In one paragraph, explain what KL divergence measures when comparing two next-token distributions.
In one paragraph, explain why cosine similarity of logits can be high even if top-1 changes occasionally.
You are profiling inference. Explain the difference between prefill throughput and decode throughput in autoregressive generation.
Give a short explanation of why caching FFT(weight) is a valid optimization in inference for structured layers.
Explain why patching only a single transformer layer might not lead to a noticeable end-to-end speedup.
In two sentences, explain how block partitioning with size B affects both runtime and approximation quality.
Provide a short description of what top-k overlap captures that top-1 accuracy does not.
Explain why using float32 inside FFT operations can help numerical stability, even if the model runs in float16 overall.
Write a concise definition of a circulant matrix and why it can be multiplied using FFT.
Explain how a loss-aware projection of dense blocks into a structured form can reduce error compared to a naive average.
Give a short explanation of why very short prompts can make evaluation metrics noisier for last-token comparisons.
In two sentences, explain why MLP layers are often a target for compression in transformer inference.
Explain how you would choose calibration prompts so that the calibrated parameters generalize to evaluation prompts.
Write a short interpretation of a result where KL increases significantly for B=256 compared to B=64.
In one sentence, summarize the overall trade-off you observed between block size, quality metrics, and throughput.
